## House Price Prediction: A Machine Learning Project (Kaggle Competition)

**What is this project?**

This project tackles the challenge of predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. It leverages a dataset from the Kaggle competition "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques," which provides detailed information about residential properties in Ames, Iowa. 

**Why did we do it?**

Developing this project served several key purposes:

* **Demonstrate Expertise in Machine Learning:**  We aimed to showcase our proficiency in applying machine learning algorithms to solve real-world business problems. Predicting house prices accurately has significant ramifications for the real estate industry.
* **Data Analysis and Exploration:** We delved into the rich dataset provided by Kaggle, analyzing various features that influence house prices. This data exploration unveils hidden trends and patterns that can inform sound investment decisions.
* **Model Building and Evaluation:** We built and evaluated different machine learning models, specifically focusing on TensorFlow and Random Forest models. This process allowed us to identify the model that delivers the most accurate house price predictions.

**What are the gains from doing this project?**

By completing this project, you will achieve the following gains:

* **Stronger Technical Skills:** Gain practical experience in data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation using TensorFlow and Random Forest models.
* **Improved Problem-Solving Approach:** Develop a structured approach to solving complex business problems by leveraging machine learning techniques.
* **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Equip yourself with the ability to extract insights from data to make informed and data-driven decisions, particularly in the context of real estate investments.

**Data Description**

This project utilizes a comprehensive dataset from the Kaggle competition "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" ([https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)). The dataset encompasses a wide range of features that influence house prices, such as:

* Property characteristics: square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, lot size, etc.
* Location details: neighborhood, street type, proximity to amenities
* Construction details: material used for foundation, roof, etc.
* Additional features: overall quality, year built, renovation history

**Focus on TensorFlow and Random Forest Models**

This project explores two prominent machine learning models:

* **TensorFlow:** A powerful open-source library developed by Google for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning.
* **Random Forest:** An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to achieve higher prediction accuracy.

By comparing the performance of these models, we can identify the optimal approach for predicting house prices in this specific dataset.
